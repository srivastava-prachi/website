  <blockquote>
    Gasoline prices are highly salient to consumers and, for this reason, they may have an outsized
    influence on their thinking about inflation. We examine how peopleâ€™s expectations about gasoline prices influence their expectations for overall inflation. We find
    little evidence from two US household surveys that people over-react to their beliefs about expected gasoline prices when
    formulating their expectations about overall inflation.

# Work in Progress

**Role of Inflation Uncertainty on Household Wage Growth Expectations (JMP)** With [Philip Schnattinger](https://philipschnattinger.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

> Draft coming soon!
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary> 
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    In this paper, we examine the heterogeneous effects of individual-level uncertainty about prices (subjective uncertainty) on wage growth expectations, using data from the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations. Our analysis focuses on how the first moment (level) and second moment (uncertainty) of expected inflation influence wage expectations during uncertain times and how these effects vary across the income distribution. We employ a novel instrument constructed from survey responses to capture these dynamics. Our findings indicate that individual-level expected inflation uncertainty is positively associated with wage growth expectations. Furthermore, higher inflation uncertainty is linked to a larger increase in wage expectations among low-income households. We attribute this mechanism to the impact of inflation uncertainty on job search behavior, where greater uncertainty prompts more job searching and EE behavior, thereby driving wage growth. Consequently, inflation uncertainty may serve as an additional factor contributing to wage growth, particularly for lower-income workers.

*Firm climate investment: A glass half-full** With [Ivan Yotzov](https://www.iyotzov.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Nicholas Bloom], [Philip Bunn],[Paul Mizern],[Gregory Thwaites]

> Draft coming soon!
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary> 
  <br> 
  <blockquote>
    We analyse the importance of climate-related investment using a large economy-wide survey of UK firms. Over half of firms expect climate change to have a positive impact on their investment in the medium term, with around a quarter expecting a large impact of over 10\%. Around two-thirds of these investments are expected to be in addition to normal capital expenditure, with some firms investing less elsewhere. These investments will be driven by larger firms as well as those in more energy-intensive sectors. Climate investments are expected mainly in switching to green energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and firms expect to finance these mainly using internal cash reserves. Overall, although firms are expecting to invest more resources in adapting to climate change, under reasonable assumptions, these investments are still not sufficient to meet the estimated targets implied by the UK Net Zero Pathway.
