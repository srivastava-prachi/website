  <blockquote>
    Gasoline prices are highly salient to consumers and, for this reason, they may have an outsized influence on their thinking about inflation. We examine how peopleâ€™s expectations about gasoline prices influence their expectations for overall inflation. We find little evidence from two US household surveys that people over-react to their beliefs about expected gasoline prices when formulating their expectations about overall inflation.

  <blockquote>
    We analyze the importance of climate-related investment using a large economy-wide survey of UK firms. Over half of firms expect climate change to have a positive impact on their investment in the medium term, with around a quarter expecting a large impact of over 10%. Around two-thirds of these investments are expected to be in addition to normal capital expenditure, with some firms investing less elsewhere. These investments will be driven by larger firms as well as those in more energy-intensive sectors. Climate investments are expected mainly in switching to green energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and firms expect to finance these mainly using internal cash reserves. Overall, although firms are expecting to invest more resources in adapting to climate change, under reasonable assumptions, these investments are still not sufficient to meet the estimated targets implied by the UK Net Zero Pathway.

# Work in Progress

**Role of Inflation Uncertainty on Household Wage Growth Expectations** With [Philip Schnattinger](https://philipschnattinger.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

> Draft coming soon!

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    In this paper, we study the heterogeneous effects of individual-level uncertainty about prices (subjective uncertainty) on individual wage growth expectations decisions using the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations. We focus on the transmission of the first (level) and second moment (uncertainty) of expected inflation on the level of wage growth expectations during uncertain times and how these differ along the income distribution using a novel instrument constructed from the survey responses. We find that individual-level expected inflation uncertainty is positively correlated with wage growth expectations. Moreover, higher inflation uncertainty is linked to a greater rise in wage expectations for poorer households. We explain this observation with a novel mechanism: workers precautiously bargain for higher wages when uncertainty about inflation risks the erosion of their real wages. Thus, inflation uncertainty may be an additional driver of wage growth, especially for lower-income workers.

**The Drivers of Household Inflation Uncertainty** With [Philip Schnattinger](https://philipschnattinger.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

> Draft coming soon!

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    Applying the round-number methods proposed in Binder (2017), we infer an individual's cognitive uncertainty about product groups. We use the responses of individuals point expectations about gasoline, food, medical, education, rent, and gold prices in the NYFed Survey of Consumers
    Expectation. Of these individual product groups, food prices are found to be the main driver of an individual's aggregate uncertainty about future inflation. We then show that a monetary policy is most effective at reducing food price uncertainty.
