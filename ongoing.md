  <blockquote>
    Gasoline prices are highly salient to consumers and, for this reason, they may have an outsized
    influence on their thinking about inflation. We examine how peopleâ€™s expectations about gasoline prices influence their expectations for overall inflation. We find
    little evidence from two US household surveys that people over-react to their beliefs about expected gasoline prices when
    formulating their expectations about overall inflation.

# Work in Progress

**Wage and Inflation Expectations and Role of Uncertainty (JMP)** With [Philip Schnattinger](https://philipschnattinger.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

> Draft coming soon!
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary> 
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    In this paper, we study the heterogeneous effects of individual-level uncertainty of prices on individual wage expectations decisions using the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations. We focus on the transmission of the first (level) and second moment (uncertainty) of expected inflation on the level of wage expectations during uncertain times and how these differ along the income distribution. We find that individual-level expected inflation uncertainty is positively correlated with wage expectations. Moreover, higher inflation uncertainty is linked to a greater rise in wage expectations for poorer households. We explain this observation with a novel mechanism: workers precautiously bargain for higher wages when uncertainty about inflation risks the erosion of their real wages. Thus, inflation uncertainty may be an additional driver of wage growth, especially for lower-income workers.

**Firm Climate investments: Evidence from the UK** With [Ivan Yotzov](https://www.iyotzov.com/){:target="_blank"}.

> Draft coming soon!
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary> 
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    We analyse climate investment expectations using a large survey of UK firms. Firms expect climate-related investments to account for 5.4\% of their total capital expenditure over the next three years, an increase from 2.5\% over the past three years. Around two-thirds of these investments are expected to be in additional to normal capital expenditures, with some firms investing less elsewhere. Climate investments are expected mainly in switching to green energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and firms expect to finance these mainly using internal cash reserves. Climate investments will driven by larger firms as well as those in more energy-intensive sectors.
